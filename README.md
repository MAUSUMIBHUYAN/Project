                                                      BLACKJACK GAME
                                                      
OBJECTIVE : 
To design and implement a Python program that simulates a game of BLACKJACK. The python code allows the user/player to play the game against a computer controlled opponent/dealer. The primary goal of this program is to create an interactive and user friendly game that provides an enjoyable experience for the user while all the rules of the game are represented.
 
STEPS OF THE ENTIRE PROCESS:
(a)design a code to represent the deck of cards and implement functions to initialize and shuffle the cards.
(b)Secondly, distribute two cards each to the player as well as the opponent. Also one of the opponent’s cards should be face down or hidden , while all the player’s cards are known.
(c)Write a function to calculate the value of the cards one has, ranging from 1 to 13.
(d)Next, write a code that would allow the player/user to HIT or STAND. Additionally implement a logic for the opponent such that it automatically determines whether to hit or stand based on the total value of the cards that they have. The opponent has to keep on taking cards until they have a value of 17 or higher.
(e)Furthermore,  design a code that would compare the values of both the player and the opponent and finally would determine the result. 
(f)Finally ,we allow the player to play multiple rounds providing them an option whether to restart another game or quit the game.

PROJECT GOALS AND SCOPE:
1. Functional Gameplay: The main aim is to create a game that is fully functional that accurately represents the rules and the mechanisms of Blackjack. Players should be allowed to play multiple rounds, make decisions as to hit or stand and experience the flow of a real life Blackjack game.
2. User interface: Implement a user friendly interface that would display the game state as well as the players and opponents values and scores and prompts for players actions. The interface should provide clear instructions for players' understanding and enjoyment of the game.
3. Score calculation and scoring:Implement score calculations that are accurate and correctly calculate the values of each card both the opponent and the player has. The game should  correctly determine the winner.
4. Multiple rounds: Allow players to play multiple rounds of Blackjack , tracking their wins and losses.

TOOLS USED:
1. PYTHON: Python is the programming language used for developing the blackjack game 
2. GIT: Git is a source control system that helps manage the source code during development. It allows code sharing, collaboration and easy tracking of changes.
3. VISUAL STUDIO CODE: It is a code editor that offers features like code highlighting, debugging and code completion.

LESSONS LEARNED:
1.Developing a game while simultaneously using the basic features like classes, functions, objects, variables etc.
2.Developing  a deeper understanding of designing the code structure and also fixing various errors.
3.Understanding various algorithms and game logic.
